# Image and Text Classification Project
This machine learning project covers two major tasks: classifying images and classifying text data using different modeling approaches.

## üìò Notebooks

### `Image Classification.ipynb`
# Contents of Code

### 1 CNN as for Feature Extration and as a Classifier
### 2 ResNet for Feature Extraction
### 3 ViT for Feature Extraction
### 4 Include Validation set to Assess Model's Performance
# 1 CNN for Feature Extraction and a Classifier

### `Text Classification.ipynb`
# Important Notes

### Please refer to Section 3: "Print out evaluation results without saving to excel file"
# 1. Import Libraries

## üõ† Tools & Libraries
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras (for image classification)
- Scikit-learn, pandas (for text classification)
- Natural language processing techniques

## üìÅ How to Use
1. Open the appropriate notebook depending on the task.
2. Follow the code and markdown instructions for training and evaluation.
3. Ensure required datasets are available in the correct directory.

## üìå Notes
- This project is separate from prior e-commerce, TikTok, and oil prediction work.
- Intended for educational and experimentation purposes with machine learning models.
